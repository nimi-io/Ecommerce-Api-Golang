Welcome to the **E-commerce API** documentation! This API allows users to interact with an online store by registering, logging in, managing products (admins only), and placing orders. The key features include user authentication, product management, and order processing. 

To help with understanding and testing the endpoints, a Postman API collection is included: **"Ecommerce_API_Postman_Collection.json"**.

## Introduction

The **E-commerce API** is designed to simulate the functionality of an online store, providing essential features like user authentication, product management, and order handling. This project includes different levels of access: regular users and admin users.

- Regular users can:
  - Register and log in.
  - View their profile.
  - Place and manage orders.
- Admin users can:
  - Manage products (create, view, update, and delete products).
  - Update order status.

### Pre-saved Admin User

To test admin features, use the following pre-saved admin credentials:

```json
{
  "email": "admin@admin.com",
  "password": "admin"
}
```

For more detailed usage and testing, refer to the included Postman collection.
